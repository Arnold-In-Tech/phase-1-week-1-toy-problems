## Challenge 1

Challenge 1 is a student grade generator. The tool prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100. 
The output corresponds to the correct grade.

## Challenge 2 

Challenge 2 is a speed detector. The program takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”.
Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it give the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.

## Challenge 3

Challenge 3 is a net salary calculator. The program calculates an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
